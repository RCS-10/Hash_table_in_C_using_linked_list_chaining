The simplest possible hash table for storing unique integer values using linked list chaining.

The average search length should be the number of stored values divided by two times the number of buckets.
To reduce the search length, increase the number of buckets, which in turn reduces the number of linked list nodes.

Developed using TDD and the CppUTest test framework http://cpputest.github.io/
